# Resume-block-Identification
Corporate firms and enlisting agencies process varied profiles daily. This is often no task for humans. An automatic
intelligent system is needed which may put off all the very important info from the unstructured profile and rework all
of them to a standard structured format. To realize additional attention from the recruiters, most profiles are written in
various formats, together with varied font size, font color, and table cells. However, the variety of format is harmful
to data processing, like profile data extraction, automatic job matching, and candidates ranking. This work proposes
a three step approach for information extraction from profile by, 
      
      [1] Text block identification,
      [2] Vectorization of data, 
      [3] Multi-class classifier to predict different segments of a profile. 
      
Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier is used as classification algorithm for prediction.
